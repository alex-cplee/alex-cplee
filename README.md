### Hi there I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I have a Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry. I have a decade of Post-doc experience as:
<ul>
  <li>Research fellow in Professor Ruediger Hellâ€™s laboratory at the University of Heidelberg (2010-2012)</li>
  <li>EMBO long term fellow in Professor Lee Sweetloveâ€™s laboratory at the University of Oxford (2012-2014)</li>
  <li>Research associate in Professor Harvey Millarâ€™s laboratory at the University of Western Australia (2014-2021)</li>
</ul>

The main theme of my previous research projects was "Plant mitochondrial membrane carriers". I was responsible for collecting small to medium scale data (3-100 samples) of at least two variables (i.e. genotypes and/or conditions), analysing data with appropriate statistics, teaching and mentoring/leading students.

Check out my previous <a href='https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=cxreV4YAAAAJ&hl=en'>Publications</a></li>! 

I am currently seeking a career in data analytics, ultilising my research, writing, data analysis and coding skills to provide technical and analytical supports for decision-making processes in the public and commercial sectors.

##  Applications/Tools
### [ARAMEMNON Scraper](https://github.com/alex-cplee/ARAMEMNON-Scraper)
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/alex-cplee/ARAMEMNON-Scraper/blob/main/Graphics/AramemScrap.png" width="200" height="200"></img>
This is a R-based web scraping app for obtaining gene annotation and transmembrane domain information of a large number of genes from [ARAMEMNON](http://aramemnon.uni-koeln.de/). This is entirely a web-based app, so you don't have to worry about reading, writing or modifying codes - just run the script in R, upload your gene list, grap your coffee/tea and wait for the job to finish. The script feeds your list of plant genes into the database and returns a table for determining whether your genes are soluble/peripheral or membrane proteins and the number of predicted transmembrane domains according to the Consensus TM alpha helix prediction ([AramTmCon](http://aramemnon.uni-koeln.de/proj_view2.ep?id=tm&mode=1)). The app was built using RStudio.

### Rapid Data Reporter for Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis Software
*Repository under construction*

A R script I routinely used for reporting data exported from the Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis Software in an instance. This script will transform multi-index excel table into appropriate dataframe and normalise raw data using a user-entered normalisation factor(s). Multiple bar graphs will then be generated (depending on the number of experimental conditions/variables) in one panel and statistical analysis is carried out using one-way ANOVA, normality tests and post-hoc Tukey test. The fully automated process takes only a few seconds to go through hundreds of samples. 

## Data Analytics
### [WA Public Service Perception Survey 2015](https://github.com/alex-cplee/WA-Public-Service-Perception-2015)
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/alex-cplee/WA-Public-Service-Perception-2015/blob/main/Graphics/WA_Perth_Parliament.jpg" width="180" height="150"></img>

Status: *Under development*

In this project, I analyzed the public sector employee perception survey data conducted by the Western Australia Public Sector Commission in 2015, available [here](https://data.gov.au/data/organization/public-sector-commission-wa). Using the data, I examined if there are gender gaps in job satisfaction, salary and career opportunities within the WA public sector. Access the analysis by [clicking here](https://github.com/alex-cplee/WA-Public-Service-Perception-2015/blob/main/SurveyData.ipynb) (Jupyter Notebook report) or by [clicking here](https://github.com/alex-cplee/WA-Public-Service-Perception-2015/blob/main/PowerBI_dashborad.pbix?raw=true) (Power BI dashboard). The report was generated using Jupyter Notebook with SQL and Python as the languages for data cleaning, manipulation and visualisation.
